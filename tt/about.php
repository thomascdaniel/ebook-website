<tr><td style='font-size:20;'>An eBook is an electronic version of a traditional print book that can be read by using a personal computer or by using an eBook reader. (An eBook reader can be a software application for use on a computer, such as Microsoft's free Reader application, or a book-sized computer that is used solely as a reading device, such as Nuvomedia's Rocket eBook.) Users can purchase an eBook on diskette or CD, but the most popular method of getting an eBook is to purchase a downloadable file of the eBook (or other reading material) from a Web site (such as Barnes and Noble) to be read from the user's computer or reading device. Generally, an eBook can be downloaded in five minutes or less.</td></tr>

<tr><td>The prices of e-readers are constantly going down. Most popular models, Kindle from Amazon and Nook from Barnes & Noble, cost below $100.
On the other side, e-readers are single-purpose devices. Some of them offer extra features like web browsing, but you should be really careful about it. E-readers have technical limitations (like e-paper screen), and they are not meant to give anything more than a sheer pleasure of reading.
Tablets are usually more expensive than e-readers, but they are also more versatile. You can use them for other purposes, such as emails, social media, web browsing, video, or games. They will also let you read ebooks that are enhanced with images, videos, or interactive elements.
Usually, when someone is looking for a device, first thing she or he does is to find out what tech reviewers think.
Well, my advice is: don’t rely on experts. They will only tell you whether the new generation Kobo is a 3 or 5-star e-reader, but they won’t help you recognize your own e-reading preferences.</td></tr>
